Before uninstalling Flutter, you have a few things to consider:

- Do you want to uninstall only Flutter, or also Dart? Dart is contained within the Flutter SDK, so it might be easiest to uninstall Flutter and then do a fresh Dart install.
- Do you also want to uninstall Android Studio? Xcode? CocoaPods? If so, refer to the docs for those tools.

### Removing .pub_cache

Package dependencies are stored in a global cache so that pub does not have to re-download the same versions of the package for different packages.

To remove .pub_cache

- Navigate to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Pub\Cache` and delete the folder.

{{site.alert.note}}
If the .pub_cache location was changed using the PUB_CACHE environment variable, navigate to that location and then right click and delete the folder.
{{site.alert.end}}

- If you’re unaware of the location and want to get the path,
  Open Command Prompt and run

```bash
echo %PUB_CACHE%.
```

- Navigate to the location specified and perform the above steps.

### Update your path

- In the search bar, type ‘env’ and select **Edit Environment Variables**.

- Select the Path variable, and remove the path containing `flutter/bin`.

**You’ve successfully removed Flutter and Dart from your machine**.

### Uninstall using Snap Store,

If Flutter was installed using the snap store on Linux, remove it by running

```bash
sudo snap remove flutter
```

### Update your path,

Depending on the shell you use, open the configuration script file using your preferred text editor or terminal editor. For example:

- By default, on Linux,

```bash
 vi $HOME/.bashrc
```

On Mac,

```zsh
  vi $HOME/.zshrc
```

- In the PATH variable, remove the text from the beginning of the Flutter path up to, and including, the trailing colon.
- Save and exit.
